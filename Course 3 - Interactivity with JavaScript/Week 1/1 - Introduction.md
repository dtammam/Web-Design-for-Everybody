### What you can do with it
- JavaScript is a "real" progarmming language
    - Store variables
    - Set decision points
    - Loop
    - Reuse code with functions
- In addition,
    - Gets data from the browser
    - Manipulate the DOM that browsers use to create web pages

### Variables
- Store data and refer back to it later

### Decision Points
- Use control statements to decide which code to run under different circumstances

### Looping
- Avoid writing the same (or similar) code over and over again
- Determine at runtime how many times you want to run some code

### Functions
- Reuse code multiple times, but only write it once
- Use code from others

### Manipulating the DOM
- JavaScript can find, add, and delete elements from the DOM
- Can also react to mouse clicks, page reloads, and other actions

### Review
- A major component of learning any programming language is practice and repetition
- Expect to make mistakes - if you aren't, you aren't learning
