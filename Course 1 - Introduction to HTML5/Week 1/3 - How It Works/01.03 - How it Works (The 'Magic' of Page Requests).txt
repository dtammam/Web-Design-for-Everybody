01.03 - How it Works (The 'Magic' of Page Requests).txt

___


How Does This All Work?
	http://si.umich.edu
- When you type an address into the URL bar, what happens?

Client/Server Relationship
- Servers
	- Machines that hold shared resources
	- Always connected to the network

- Clients
	- Machines for personal use (laptops, phones, etc.)

Request/Response Cycle
- This is what happens when your computer (the client) requests a page and a server responds with the appropriate files.

Uniform Resource Locator
	http://si.umich.edu
- URL has three parts:
	- Protocol - how to connect
	- Domain - the server*
	- (Optional) Document - the specific file needed
		- Most pages are made up of multiple files

Protocols
- HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- HTTPS - Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- FTP - File Transfer Protocol

Domain Names
- Identifies the entity you want to connect to
	- umich.edu, google.com, wikipedia.org
- Each has different top-level domain (TLD) edu, com, org
	- Determined by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
	- https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en

IP Addresses
- Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the communication protocol that identifies computers on networks.
- Every computer has a unique IP address
	xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
where x can have 16 different values.
- Can represent over 300 trillion unique combinations (2 to the 128th power)!

The Domain Name Server (DNS)
- Luckily, you don't need to remember the IP address of a domain.
- The DNS will lookup the IP address based on the URL you type in.

Document
- URLs can specify a specific Document
	- http://www.intro-webdesign.com/contact.html (contact.html)
	- http://www.intro-webdesign.com/Ashtabula/harbor.html (Ashtabula/harbor.html)
- If no document is specified, the default document is returned.
	- Convention is index.html

The Request
- Once the IP address is determined, the browser creates an HTTP request.
- Lots of hidden information in this request
	- Header, cookies, form data, etc.

The Response
- The server returns files, not web pages
	- It is up to the browser to decide what to do with those files
- If the server can't fulfill the request it will send back files with error codes: 404, 500, etc.

What Literally Happens When You Type "http://si.umich.edu/" into the address bar and press Enter:
1. The browser looks up the domain in DNS
2. The DNS returns the IP address 54.88.175.189
3. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server located at that address
4. The server finds the requested file and sends it back as a response
5. The browser takes the response and renders the HTML code as a nice graphical presentation, often repeating steps 3-4 as needed to request images and other supporting files

Review
- A URL has three parts.
- Request/Response cycle typically requires multiple rounds of communication between the client and server.
