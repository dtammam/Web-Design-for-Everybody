01.02 - The Evolution of HTML.txt

___


What is HTML?
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
- Markup langages are not the same as programming languages, they use tags to annotate documents.
- In HTML the tags indicate where headings, images, lists, links, line breaks and other components should go.

.html Files
- When your computer opens a .html file, it knows to open it in an Internet Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- The browser can read this file and know how to display it on the screen.
- Screen readers and other assistive devices can also utilize the HTML tags to present the information in special ways.
- HTML is similar to english.

"Learning" HTML
- In the beginning we worry about syntax
	- What tags are there?
	- Did I remember to "end" my tag?
- Later we will worry about semantics
	- Is there a tag that better conveys the meaning I am trying to get across?
	- If someone is searching my page can they find what they need and access it easily?

Early Years
- HTML1 was created in 1990 as a way to electronically connect documents via hyperlinks (hence a "web" of connections)
- In 1993, Mosaic emerged as the first graphical browser and introduced the idea of images
- World wide web proliferates at a 341634% annual growth rate of service traffic
- Mosaic had challengers though in the form of Netscape (1994), Internet Explorer (1995) and others

The Browser Wars
- Browsers had proprietary tags
	- <marquee>...</marquee> (scrolling text)
	- <blink>...</blink> (blinking text)
- Other tags that went against the spirit of the original tenets of HTML were added, e.g. <font>, <center>, and <bgcolor>
- Origination of "Best viewed on" messages between browsers

Web Standards
- No one "runs" the Internet or the Web, some groups do take proactive roles:
	- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
	- World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
	- The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

Evolution of Browsers
	_Years_			_Example_
	1990-1994		HTML was simple, content was primarily text-based
	1993			Mosaic enters the scene with images and BOOM!
	1995-1999		Cross-browser compatibility falls apart
	2000-2005		Browsers move toward separating content from style
	2005-2008		Using HTML files in coordination with CSS becomes the new standard

Evolution of HTML
	_Years_			_Version and References_
	1993			HTML 1.0 - Developed by Tim Berners-Lee to link documents
	1995			HTML 2.0 - Developed by Internet Engineering Task Force RFC to include stylized text and tables
	1996			CSS 1
	1997			HTML 4.0 - A move back to normalizing the pages across platforms
	1998			CSS 2
	1999			HTML 4.01 - Introduced different document types
	2012			HTML 5 - Back to HTML plus multimedia and semantic tags

Where are we now?
- HTML5 is a cooperation between W3C and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
- Established guidelines
	- New features should be based on HTML, CSS, the DOM, and JavaScript
	- Reduce the need for external plugins (e.g. Flash)
	- More markup to replace scripting
	- HTML5 should be device independent

Review
- Browsers translate HTML documents into viewable webpages
- HTML was intended to facilitate content types
- When designers want to do something new they write non-standard code to force browsers to do it
- New standards are written to handle new requirements and browsers adopt the new standards
