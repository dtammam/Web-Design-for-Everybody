Week 1:
	- Focus on questions:
		- What happens when you type an address into a URL?
		- What types of tools you need to code (editors and browsers)?
		- What is HTML5?

Week 2:
	- A little bit of theory and code:
		- The DOM (document object model)
		- Contextual tags and headings

Week 3:
	- Putting it all together
		- Validating your code
			- Syntax
			- Accessibility
		- Domain name registration and web Hosting

Final Project:
	- Create a syntactically valid multipage website
	- Must pass W3C Validation
	- Must pass WAVE accessibility review
	- It'll be 'ugly' since we won't be focusing on styling
