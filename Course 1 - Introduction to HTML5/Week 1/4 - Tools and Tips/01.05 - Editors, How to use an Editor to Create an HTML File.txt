___


Creating and Editing Your Files
	1. Decide on how you will organize your Files
	2. Decide on a naming convention
		- dash-between, camelCase
		- No spaces, Consistent capitalization
	3. Decide on an Editor
		- Windows (Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime)
		- Mac (TextEdit, TextWrangler, Sublime)

Getting Started
	1. Open your Editor
	2. Select Save or Save As and name your File
	3. Add Doctype, head and body tags
	4. Save File
	5. Open in a browser

Troubleshooting
- My file opens in an editor, not a browser!
	- Right-click and select 'Open with...'
- My browser shows my tags!
	- Check that the file extension is .html
- I changed my code, but my page looks the same.
	- Refresh your browser
	- Verify file name
- I get 'weird' characters.
	- Try typing code in by hand, not copy-and-paste
