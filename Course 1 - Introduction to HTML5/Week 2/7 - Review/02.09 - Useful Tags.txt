Choosing Your Tags
- Generic 
	- <p>
	- <div>

- Semantic
	- <header>
	- <nav>
	- <footer>
	- <figure>

Block Tags (forces a newline above and below)
- Containers
	- <article>
	- <aside>
	- <section>
	- <main>
- <hr> - horizontal rule, contains no text at all
- <address> - allows screenreaders to quickly find an address
- <blockquote> - has cite attribute
- <details> with <summary> - dropdown open/close idea with text

Inline Tags (can be put in the page, aligned one after another)
- <span> was the original inline tag for plain text
- <cite> - easier for people and bots to search for this info
- <abbr> - hover-over functionality to expand the abbreviated text, good for accessibility
- <time> - gives extra semantic meaning, good for descriptor of a time of an event, good for mobile
- <code> - identifies code fragment, typically displayed in a different font
- <sub> (subscript) - for mathematical formulas, raise the 3
- <sup> (superscript) - for mathematical formulas, lower the 2\

Tags that need "more"
- <button> - a button to click to do a thing
- <meter> - shows a visual meter
- <progress> - similar to meter except with the assumption of progression to 100, shows proportional value
- <iframe> - often used to embed documents
- <bdo> bidirectional orientation - attribute dir (ltr, left to right or rtl, right to left) think Arabic language
- <map> with <area> - creates "clickable element in image" but needs JavaScript

Review
- Use the most specific tag possible
- Sometimes tags "don't work"
	- Run your code through a validator, you may have a syntax error
	- Run your code in multiple browsers (good idea even if your code looks good)
