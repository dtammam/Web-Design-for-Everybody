Links
- Links are what makes the Web a web.
- The interlinked nature of the web leads to the "knowledge" that search engines appear to have.

Anchor Links
<a href="http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>
- The <a> tag stands for anchor link
- Needs a hyper-reference AND content
	- href: Reference to location of new content
	- content: The "clickable" part (text or image)

Types of Links:
- Absolute
- Relative
I Internal
- Graphical

Absolute Reference:
<a href="http://www.intro-webdesign.com/">Web Design</a>
	- <a... > = Opening tag
	- </a> = Closing tag
	- "http://www.intro-webdesign.com/" = Where to go on click
	- Web Design = Clickable text

Relative References
<a href="page2.html">Second Page</a>
	- page2.html = Link to a local file in the same folder

<a href="docs/page2.html">Second Page</a>
	- docs/page2.html = Link to a local file in a different folder called "docs"

<a href="#history">History section</a>
	- #history = Link to a different location in the same file

Absolute vs Relative
- When would you use absolute links?
	- When you are not in charge of the page, someone elwse

- When would you use relative links?
	- When you are in charge of your own webpages
	- Simpler to manage if migrating files from server to server... don't need to rename anything
	- Your lihnks should never have folders that are specific to your computer like 'C:\page2.html'

Using Images as the Link
- The "clickable" component doesn't have to be text.

	<a href=http://www.redcross.org"?><img src = "imgs/redcross-logo.png" alt = "Red Cross logo"/></a>
	<a href="http://www.redcross.org">
		<img src = "http://www.redcross.org/images/redcross-logo.png" alt = "Red Cross logo"/>
	</a>

Usability Issues
- Make sure the clickable component has an informative name
- Information in the images should be availabile to those who can't see the image

You can set reference zones with 'id's:
	<div id = "relative">
		<h2>Relative References</h2>
		<p>Stuff and words and things</p>

Targets
- Anchors can take a target attribute
	- _self - default action
	- _blank - open in a new tab or window
	- _top and _parent

Review:
- A page without links is rare
- Links can be absolute, relative and internal
- Use caution when using images in links
