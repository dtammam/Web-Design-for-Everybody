The Document Object Model (DOM)
- Basis of HTML5 is "New features should be based on HTML, CSS, the DOM and JavaScript..."
- DOM provides common tree-like structure that all pages should follow
- Computer scientists love trees (mathematical kind) because you can test them

- At the root of the tree, we will create <html>
	--- We then want the <head>
	------ Where we'll put our <title>
	--------- Where we'll put our <title>'s text

	--- And then want the body
	------ Where we'll put all of our html tags, like <a> href
	--------- Where we'll put all of our html tags, like <a> href's text
	------ Where we'll put all of our html tags, like <h1>
	--------- Where we'll put all of our html tags, like <h1>'s text

Three parts of a well-formed document:
- Doctype
	- Version of HTML that you will be using
- Head
	- Metadata
- Body
	- Displayable content

Doctype
- HTML5
	- <!DOCTYPE html>

- Previous versions dictated backwards compatibility
	- <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
	- <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

Head
- Additional information used by the browser
	- Metadata - language, title
	- Supporting files - JavaScript, styling, add-ons
	- Title - The small title of the pages
- Other than title, metadata is not displayed

Body
- Bulk of your page
- Important to write well-formatted (tree-like) code
- Most of the content is displayed by the browser, but there may be some metadata too

Validate the Code
- https://validator.w3.org

Review
- Well-formed pages use the DOM structure
	- Use beginning and end tags
	- Close inner tags before outer ones
	- Use valid attributes
- Browsers will "fix" bad code, but not always well. Use a validator to check your code
