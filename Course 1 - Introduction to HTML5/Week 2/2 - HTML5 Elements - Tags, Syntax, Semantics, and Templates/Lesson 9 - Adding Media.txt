Lesson 9: Adding Media https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/adding-media/ (Only read up to "Sizing Images")

- We can freely use images, audio, video and inline frames across all browsers.

Adding Images
- To add an image use <img> inline element.
- `src` element is the source of the file and `alt` is the alternative text to convey the purpose of the image
	<img src="dog.jpg" alt="A black, brown and white dog wearing a kerchief">

- Supported image formats:
	- gif
	- jpg
	- png

Sizing Images
	- Sized with `width` and `height` attributes within the <img> tag
	- CSS uses them too, if in use, CSS takes precedence
	- Done on a pixel basis
		img {
			height: 200px;
			width: 200px;
		}

Positioning Images
	- By default images are positioned as inline-level elements
	- Positions may be changed with CSS using `float` and `display`
	- Box model properties are `padding`, `border` and `margin`
