<!-- To italicize text, thereby placing emphasis on it, we’ll use the <em> inline-level element. As with the elements for bold text, there are two different elements that will italicize text, each with a slightly different semantic meaning.

The <em> element is used semantically to place a stressed emphasis on text; it is thus the most popular option for italicizing text. The other option, the <i> element, is used semantically to convey text in an alternative voice or tone, almost as if it were placed in quotation marks. Again, we will need to gauge the significance of the text we want to italicize and choose an element accordingly.

Here’s the HTML code for italicizing: -->

<!-- Stressed emphasis -->
<p>I <em>love</em> Chicago!</p>

<!-- Alternative voice or tone -->
<p>The name <i>Shay</i> means a gift.</p>
