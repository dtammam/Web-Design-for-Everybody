Lesson 11: Organizing Your Data with Tables https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/organizing-data-with-tables/ (Only read up to "Combining Multiple Cells")

- HTML tables were created to provide a straightforward way to mark-up structured tabular data and to provide a way to display that data in a form that's easy to digest.
- This was done pre-CSS.
- Nowadays... we organize data with HTML and use CSS to position and lay it out.

Creating a Table
- Tables are made up of data contained within columns and rows
- Table must consist of:
	- The table itself <table>
	- A table row <tr>
	- Table data <td>
		- You can optionally include table header <th>

Table
	- Use <table> to initialize a table on a page

	<table>
		...
	</table>

Table Row
	- One a table is defined.. you can add rows with <tr>
	- You can use multiple <tr>s

	<table>
		<tr>
			...
		</tr>
		<tr>
			...
		</tr>
	</table>

Table Data
	- Once defined and rows are setup, data cells may be added with <td> elements
	- Listing multiple <td> elements one after the other creates multiple columns within a row

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Don&#8217;t Make Me Think by Steve Krug</td>
			<td>In stock</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>$30.02</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A Project Guide to UX Design by Russ Unger &#38; Carolyn Chandler</td>
			<td>In stock</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>$52.94 ($26.47 &#215; 2)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Introducing HTML5 by Bruce Lawson &#38; Remy Sharp</td>
			<td>Out of stock</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>$22.23</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Bulletproof Web Design by Dan Cederholm</td>
			<td>In stock</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>$30.17</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

Table header
	- To designate a heading, use <th> element
	- Works just like <td> 
	- Use `scope` to identify what content the header relates to
	- Follows `col`, `row`, `colgroup` and `rowgroup`

		<table>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Item</th>
			<th scope="col">Availability</th>
			<th scope="col">Quantity</th>
			<th scope="col">Price</th>
		<tr>
			<td>Don&#8217;t Make Me Think by Steve Krug</td>
			<td>In stock</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>$30.02</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A Project Guide to UX Design by Russ Unger &#38; Carolyn Chandler</td>
			<td>In stock</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>$52.94 ($26.47 &#215; 2)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Introducing HTML5 by Bruce Lawson &#38; Remy Sharp</td>
			<td>Out of stock</td>
			<td>0</td>			<td>$22.23</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Bulletproof Web Design by Dan Cederholm</td>
			<td>In stock</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>$30.17</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

Table Caption
	- <caption> element provides a caption/title for the table
	- Must come immediately after the <table> tag

	<table>
		<caption>Design and Front-End Development Books</caption>
		...
	</table>

Table Head, Body and Foot
	- <thead> is table head, wraps the heading row to denote the header, placed after <caption>
	- <tbody> is table body, contains the primary data within a table
	- <tfoot> is table footer, contains the data that outlines the content
