<!--For example, if we have a <div> with an orange background that contains social media links, our first thought might be to give the <div> a class value of orange. What happens if that orange background is later changed to blue? Having a class value of orange no longer makes sense. A more sensible choice for a class value would be social, as it pertains to the contents of the <div>, not the style.-->

<!-- Division -->
<div class="social">
	<p>I may be found on...</p>
	<p>Additionally, I have a profile on...</p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Span -->
  <p>Soon we'll be <span class="tooltip">writing HTML</span> with the best of them.</p>
