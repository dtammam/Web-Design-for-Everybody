Lesson 8: Creating Lists https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/creating-lists/ (Only read up to "List Item Styling")

Lists Overview
- HTML provides three types of lists to choose from:
	- Unordered
	- Ordered
	- Description
- Multiple ways to style the lists

Unordered Lists
- Simply a list of related items whose order doesn't matter
- Unordered list block-level element
- Starts with <ul> unorganized list element, each line underneath <li>
	- <ul>
		<li>Orange</li>
		<li>Blue</li>
		<li>Green</li>
	</ul>

Ordered Lists
- Ordered list is similar to unordered except starts with <ol> and are numbered versus bulleted when displayed

	- <ol>
		<li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
		<li>Turn right on the first parkwayt</li>
		<li>After 500 feet you have reached yur destination</li>
	</ol>
	- Also have unique attributes available including 'start' and 'reversed'

	Start attribute
	- Defines the number from which an ordered list should start
	- Only accepts integer values even though ordered lists may use other types of numerals

	Reversed attribute
	- Reverses the order of the numbers in an ordered list

	Value attribute
	- May be used on an individual <li> to change its' value within the list

Description Lists
- Not as common as the others but still used- Used to outline multiple terms and their descriptions like a glossary
- Starts with a <dl> element
- Instead of <li> uses a description term <dt> and descrption element <dd>
- <dt> must come before <dd>
- By default, <dl> element will include vertical margins like <ul> and <ol>

Nesting Lists
- <ul> and <ol> can only contain <li> elements 
- Nested lists will change iconography depending on the level
