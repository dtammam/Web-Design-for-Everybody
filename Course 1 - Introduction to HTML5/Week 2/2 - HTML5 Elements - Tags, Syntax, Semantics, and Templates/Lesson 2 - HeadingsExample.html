<!-- Headings should be used in an order that is relevant to the content of a page. The primary heading of a page or section should be marked up with an <h1> element, and subsequent headings should use <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6> elements as necessary.

Each heading level should be used where it is semantically valued, and should not be used to make text bold or bigâ€”there are other, better ways to do that.

Here is an example of HTML for all the different heading levels and the resulting display on a web page. -->

<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
