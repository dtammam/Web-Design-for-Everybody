Images - it's more than the tag
	- Many file types are widely supported
		- JPEG (.jph and .jpeg), GIF, and PNG
		- SVG and BML are additional options
		- File extensions must be included
	- Every image must be downloaded, so size can be a factor
	- Every Image requires an HTTP request

Image Sizes
	- When you link to an image the browser displays the image as big (or small) as the file.
		- This size is rarely optimal
	- "Quick" solutons - change file, use width/height attributes

Using an Editor
	- Editors can be used to permanently change the size of an image
		- Only works on local files
	Built-in software for this includes Preview (Mac) and Paint (Windows)

Using Attributes
	- Always strive to keep style out of your HTML files but...
	- <img> tag includes width and height attributes

Default Image Size
	<figure>
		<img src = "imgs/Ashtabula.jpg"
		alt = "My house">
		<figcaption>Default image size</figcaption>
	</figure>

Using Width in Pixels
	<figure>
		<img src = "imgs/Ashtabula.jpg"
		width = "500px"
		alt = "My house">
		<figcaption>Set image size</figcaption>
	</figure>

Using Width in Pixels
	<figure>
		<img src = "imgs/Ashtabula.jpg"
		width = "500px"
		height = "100px"
		alt = "My house">
		<figcaption>Skewed image size</figcaption>
	</figure>

Using Percentages
	<figure>
		<img src = "imgs/Ashtabula.jpg"
		width = "50%"
		alt = "My house">
		<figcaption>Relative image size</figcaption>
	</figure>

Favicons
	- You can put image/logo/icon next to the title of your page (in the tab)
	- Must be .ico or .png
	- Must go in <head> section
		<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="imgs/wd4elogo.png" />

Alternative Text Attribute
	- Provides a textual alternative to non-text content
	- Read by screen readers
	- Displayed in place of Images
	- Provides semantic meaning for search engines

Creating Good alt text
	- Be accurate
	- Be succinct
	- Don't be redundant
	- Don't include "picture of...", "graphic of..."

Empty alt text
	- It is okay to leave alt text empty (null)
		- Decorative images used for non-informative purpose
	- Don't skip the alt attribute, though!

Review:
	- Misuse of file extensions, filename, and file paths are often a problem
	- For now, style the height/width in the html code.
