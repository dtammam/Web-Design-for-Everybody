Objectives:
- Describe HTML5 audio and video elements
- Explain the purpose of plugins
- Reflect on Acessibility issues

HTML5 Multimedia:
- Designed to avoid the use of extra software to play music/video
- Not fully implemented

Video element <video>
- Video tag uses a src attribute or embedded <source>
- Common attributes:
	- height, width
	- autoplay
	- loop
	- controls
- Text inside <video>...</video> is displayed if browser cannot support the tag

Audio element <audio>
- Audio tag uses a src attribute to link to audio file, typically .mp3 or .wav
- Common attributes:
	- autoplay, controls, loop
	- buffered
	- muted
	- volume

Setting clips
- You can set both the video and audio elements to play clips by adding to the src attribute:
	- .ext#t=5, 25
	- .ext#t=, 39
	- .ext#t=, 1:38:45
	- .ext#t=42

Plugins
- Before HTML5 there was no standard for video display, plugins were required
- Since not all browsers suport new tag some may require flash

Accessibility Issues
- Make sure to provide links to plugins
- Include text descriptions and closed captioning (or other equivalent content)
- Multimedia should enhance your content, not be a distraction
