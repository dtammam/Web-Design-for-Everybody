___


Connecting to CPanel
- You will need to have the URL for your cPanel account
	- Usually a version of your domain name or your hosting service domain name

File Manager
- Regardless of the cPanel configuration, every system should have a File Manager.
- From the File Manager, search for the public_html (or in some cases, just public) folder.

public_html
- Your site will have a lot of files, some that you want people to see, some that you don't.
- Uploading files to public_html folder should make them viewable to the public

Wait? Why can't I view my file?
- You typed in the wrong URL
- When you uploaded the file the transfer didn't work
- When you uploaded the file, it did not have "read access" and would need permissions changed

Working locally
- It is possible to edit your files via cPanel but I don't do that
	- Changes are immediately public
	- Less opportunity to test and debug

Review
- Versions of cPanel often differ depending on if you are using paid or free site
- Offers many administrative tools (email accounts, database management, cron jobs)
- An alternative is to use sftp to transfer files
