___


To Go Live

1. Upload the files
- Login to GitHub
- Create a new repo
	- Repo name should be lowercase, BnL doesn't matter what it is
	- Make it a 'Public' repo
	- Select 'Initialize this repository with a README'
- Once ready, drag and drop the entire directory with all files in at once
- Commit changes

2. Go Live
- In the repo, select 'Settings'
	- Scroll down to 'GitHub Pages'
	- Go to 'None', select 'master branch' and then select 'Save'
	- To confirm, scroll back down to see 'Source - your GitHub pages site is currently being built from the master branch' with the URL visible'
	- Follow the absolute path in the URL

- If you forget, manually create a README
- Drag and drop is the easiest way to copy all files in a single upload
- Give GitHub a few minutes to process post-upload
