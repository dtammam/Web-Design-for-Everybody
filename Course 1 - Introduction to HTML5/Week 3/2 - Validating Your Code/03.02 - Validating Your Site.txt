03.02 - Validating Your Site.txt

___


Why validate?
- Browsers are the helicopter parents of programming
- As your pages become more complex "hidden" areas can be devastating

Three approaches
1. Validate by URI
2. Validate by Filename
3. Validate by Direct Input

Don't freak out!
- Errors propagate, so always start at the top
- Search for solutions online and in forums

Accessibility Validation
- You can use wave.webaim.org to validate accessibility

Review
- Validated sites are more robust and more accessible
