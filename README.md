# Web Design for Everybody

`Hello world!` Back at it again, looking to enter the world of web development.
It's 1/8/2023 and at this stage of my programming journey, I now know and can implement solutions in:

   - A hodgepodge of older Microsoft languages (VBScript, Batch Script)
   - Python
   - PowerShell
   - C#

The future looks to be changing due to the nature of AIðŸ¤– and my bid is that until the majority of cognitive labor jobs are obsolete (*if that is to happen, which my money is on*) people will need to work with AI to implement the solutions. In the short and medium term, JavaScript looks like a useful tool to learn. 

Taking the plunge with this course as I'd like to really understand HTML more than the old-school MySpace days and want to combine the powers of Python/PowerShell, JavaScript and HTML to create cool intermediary web portals and API calls. At the end of this class, I'll know:

 - A variety of Microsoft-oriented interpreted languages
 - A mix of interpreted and compiled languages, with both soft and hard typing
 - A sense of code sanitation and an ethos to make sure any code I put out is clean and iterative
 - A meaningful way to programmatically interact with the web in a way I couldn't before

Wish me luck ðŸ™‚
