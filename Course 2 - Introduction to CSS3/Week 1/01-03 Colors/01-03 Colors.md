### Color Conventions
- Color names (blue, red, yellow, etc.) work, but should be avoided
- Hexaecimal is common convention
	- #0000FF (Blue)
	- #FF0000 (Red)
	- #FFFF00 (Yellow)
- rgb
	- (0, 0, 1) (Blue)
	- (1, 0, 0) ()
	- (1, 1, 0)
- rgba
	- a stands for alpha transparency
	(0, 0, 1, .5) (blue with transparency, if last value is 1, it's opaque)

### Accessibility
- Appropriate use of color is critical to web accessibility
- Many more people are visually impaired or color blind than are legally blind

### What is color contrast?
- You intuitively know when something has poor contrast
- There are tools that quantify the contrast between text and its background

### Conveying Meaning
- Don't use color alone to convey meaning
- Test ideas that way in grey scale
- Make sure to use captions, alt text, etc.

### Review
- Use web safe colors and use an accepted convention
- Test your site using a contrast checker
