### Styling Specific Objects
- We have focused on *type* selectors.
- What if you don't wnat to style *all* of the link, just some? Or just some of the lists?
- CSS gives you some options

### CSS Selectors
- Some selectors follow the DOM
- Descendant selectors (nav a)
	- Style all of the anchor links inside a nav tag
- Child selectors (nav > a)
	- More constraining
	- The anchor elements must be a child of the nav, no intermediate tags, e.g. paragraph
- Adjacent siblings (h1 + ol)
	- elements must be at the same level and follow eachother

### id Selectors
- \# id selector
	- Used to identify a single element in the DOM.
	- Was used extensively for \<div id = "header">, \<div id="footer">, etc.
	- There is a small movement to move the use of id OUT of CSS

			#mainLogo{
				border: 5px solid #0006CC;
				margin:0 auto;
			}

			<img src="logo.jpg" id="mainLogo" alt="logo/>

### class Selector
- . class selector
	- Used to identify an element in the DOM that is part of a special class of items
	- Think of thumbnail images, all of the links that are in the navigation, your social media images, etc...

			.thumb{
				border: 1px solid #0006CC;
				width:20%;
			}

			<img src="cat.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Joe"/>
			<img src="dog.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Bacon"/>
			<img src="bird.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Tweety"/>

### class vs id
- Syntax is "." and "#"
- classes can be used multiple times
- id should be unique
- Think of images and navigation bars
	- Format numerous (but not all) images the same way
	- Visually signify the current page

### Narrowing the Scope
- As you get more advanced pages, you will want to narrow the scope of the action
- p.*main* -> paragraphs using the *main* class
- header img.*special* -> paragraphs inside header that use *special* class

### Expanding the Scope
- You can combine elements with a comma
	- p, h1, #main, .special{...rules to apply to all of them}

- Review: What happens when there are multiple rules for the same selector?
	- When there are conflicts, use the one processed the most recently
	- UNLESS a rule has *!important*

### More Attribute Selectors
- Universal
	- \* applies styling to every element on the page
	- Ackk!! Try this!
- Attribute Selectors
	- a[href='info.html']
- Pseudo-Classes
- Pseudo-Elements

### Attribute selectors
- You may want to search the DOM for certain elements that have an attribute you are looking for
	- All the images that use .gif files...
	- All of the images that have empty alt text...
	- All fo the links that go to government sites...

### Using Operators
- Operators can be used to find those attribute values you are looking for
	- ^ : match the beginning exactly
				
			a [href='http://umich']

	- $ : match the end exactly

			img[src$ = '.png'] -> apply to .png images

	- \* : wildcard

			a [href*='umich']

### Whew!
- We have actually covered a lot in this short video
- Know that each of these ideas can merge.
- One element can have many classes and ids associated with it.

		<li class="special early dark" id ="main"/>

- Browser "starts at the top" and applies each rule, sometimes overriding earlier rules.

### The Good News
- You can use style sheets from others to style your code, just by adding class!!
- You can override style sheets from others just by rewriting the class, or making your own version fo it and linking it last

### Review
- Type selectors can be combined to narrow the scope of where rules are applied
- An id is used to specify a sepcific element in a page
- Classes can be used to associate elements that should be treated in a similar manner
